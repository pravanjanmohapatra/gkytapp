                        <h3>Human rights and justice</h3><br>
                        <p> All of our work is based on respect for the inherent worth and dignity of all people, and the rights that follow from this understanding.
Transparency and accountability - TRUST Forum both provides and expects to access clear, accurate and up-to-date information. We are willing to hold ourselves to high standards and seek to hold others to similar standards as the ones we set for ourselves.
Sustainability - TRUST Forum is committed to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By empowering members, our networks and the communities they serve, we believe that the benefits of our work will be enduring.<br>
Cooperation and partnership - We respect the wishes and requirements of our members and networks - and the communities they serve - and we endeavour to create a shared voice, working together in a manner that enables us to achieve our shared goals and live our shared values.Peace - TRUST Forum recognises that peace is about more than the absence of conflict. TRUST Forum strives for concord, harmony and tranquillity - a balance of power.
Equity - TRUST Forum shares it own resources fairly and wants to see that the natural and intellectual wealth of Cambodia is also distributed fairly, so that everyone is able to gain their share. We know that the success of development can be measured by how the least powerful people and the smallest minority groups are faring</p><br>
